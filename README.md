# Multi Modal Path Optimization
Our goal is solve the Vehicle Routing Problem, which can be seen as a generalization of the famous Travelling Salesman Problem, using Reinforcement Learning.
The Vehicle Routing Problem can be best understood via an example.
Take any delivery company. Their aim is to deliver products to as many people as fast as possible. They have multiple trucks in the area, going to multiple locations for the dropoffs. So our ultimate goal is really to find a optimized path for each truck, or vehicle, in order to traverse set locations while minimizing time.

For this, we have decided to use MADDPG (Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient).
